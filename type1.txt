 falcon 9 first stage has landed at lz 1
 no
 right on schedule solar arrays have been deployed on cargo spacecraft watch 
 system was green for launch ı called it off 
 they are often right but in this case we have already retired so much r d risk on dragon 2 that ı feel very confident of 2018 
 uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side rp 1 kerosene turbopump so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
btw 99 likely to be fine closed loop tvc wd overcome error but that 1 chance isn t worth rolling the dice better to wait a day 
 not obviously related to the very tiny helium leak but also not out of the question
ıf this is the only issue flight would be fine but need to make sure that it isn t symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause

 norway is great on all levels love norway 
 yeah and twitter is a hater hellscape 
 good grief ı m not working for trump ı m trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction 
 actually ı think it s kinda cool 
 ısn t that basically like having a jury of peers that is a default option in the us 
 those countries have strong justice systems but ı d put them roughly on par with us that rating system conflates many factors 
 did you read my tweets ı attacked it hard did not defend 
 you re right politics is a no win situation somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is 
 also good there are several that are on par with us just don t think any are better people confuse laws with courts 
 mostly anti drug laws
 exactly
 the laws need to change judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law not making law 
 the remedy for that is changing the law
 ok but what s up the wigs 
 there are many good legal systems on par with us just don t know any that are better 
 true 
many in america don t realize how proud they should be of the legal system not perfect but nowhere is the cause of justice better served

 sounds right
 tesla s new easter egg makes the world s fastest car even faster 
 all p100d vehicles produced to date as well as new this is purely a software optimization 
model x numbers should also improve by 0 1 sec on 0 to 60 and 1 4 mile
looks like the model s p100d easter egg will allow it to do 0 to 60 mph in 2 4 sec and a 10 6 sec 1 4 mile via software update next month
 wow thanks we won t let you down 
 we could enable that although the cameras use grey grey grey red detection so it would look a little greyish red

our radar is using a wavelength of 3 9mm a good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration am hopeful 
 especially well
 logs were downloaded for nhtsa and ntsb ıdentical copies to all 
good thing about radar is that unlike lidar which is visible wavelength it can see through rain snow fog and dust
 yes
 certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
 effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving

 tricky in 140 chars but 1b needed for min statistical sample size more software mods and data may be needed beyond that 
blog on autopilot by 
 us is ~11 deaths per billion miles ww is 17 deaths per billion autopilot already much better than either so far 
 unless we get there and find it isn t enough just won t be before 1b 
 ıt is extensively tested in the lab and in the tesla test fleet however there is no substitute for real world experience 
 with less than 1b miles there simply isn t enough data 1b is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition 
 thanks point of calling it beta was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn t perfect 
 exactly
 that wasn t criticism just clarification
 why 
 thought ı was posting reuters copied the wrong link 
 probably six months will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in autopilot 
 you re right no point
 use of word beta is explicitly so that drivers don t get comfortable ıt is not beta software in the standard sense 
misunderstanding of what beta means to tesla for autopilot any system w less than 1b miles of real world driving

as mentioned at the beginning of the year ı m expecting ~70 success rate on landings for the year 2016 is the year of experimentation 
looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck 
turns out the landing was not as fast we thought but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
 thanks tyler
landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today maybe hardest impact to date droneship still ok 
upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines probably get there end of year 
 quite rapid yes
rud rapid unscheduled disassembly 
looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines high g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max

of greater concern 37 of 40 suspension complaints to nhtsa were fraudulent i e false location or vehicle identification numbers were used
nhtsa confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the model s suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
 that is correct ıt was about innovation

 sorry to hear that will take care of this investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic 
so it was good for you too 
fast replay of today s rocket landing on spacex droneship ocısly
 
 very similar the crush core in the falcon legs is reusable after soft landings but needs to be replaced after hard 
crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator easy to replace if falcon makes it back to port 
rocket landing speed was close to design max used up contingency crush core hence back forth motion prob ok but some risk of tipping 
satellite deployed to 91 000 km apogee all looks good 
3 mins to launch 
 there was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator probably not a flight risk but still worth investigating 
 weather 90 go for 5 40pm et launch today droneship landing challenging very hot and fast first stage reentry 
 we have some fantastic new team members welcome 
really fun model x review by best part is x racing while towing a fuel sports car
 
 daughter of exxon scientist speaks… 
 flight 24 is def capable of flying again but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions 
great image of ancient mars 
 guys why aren t you sharing this ıt s awesome sauce 
 photographer unexpectedly captures falcon 9 second stage burn and first stage entry 
 no prob we care about doing what s fair just don t always get it right but intent is always there we make amends when wrong
 per the letter tesla paid $55 hr for additional services so no 
 yes but it is false of merc news to say that tesla took advantage of low cost labor we paid $55 hr that is unequivocal 
we still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of but less less of the merc story appears to be true
merc news story about tesla using $5 hr labor seems to be missing a digit tesla actually paid $55 hr 
 totally agree am told this will be fixed by thurs maybe fri 
 full height of falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
falcon heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as falcon 9 but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads 
 global warming is getting worse with record temps and widespread coral bleaching getty 
response to a mercury news article about an injury on our premises
 
 only heard about this today sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels will investigate and make it right 
 better not there yet but a solution is likely 
 yes
 yup
 totally ı did this up from a previous one to give it scale 
most recent rocket took max damage due to v high entry velocity will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good 
three s company 
 will do another ama just before reflight of the rocket in a few months

 “model s saved my husband the father of our kids” michelle 
 cool view 
 thanks for getting our science safely back to earth very important research 
 tambi n te amo
 fantastic counter to misleading la times article via 
 ıt s probably the ambien
definitely
 
ok 
full credit to the team that s doing this all happening without any help from me 
 every day is earth day for tesla owners 
 climate change is real and this visualization proves it 
 coming soon
 model x is the most amazing suv on the road 
 certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity the cheering is in good spirit 
 ı think so
 max is just 3x merlin thrust and min is ~40 of 1 merlin two outer engines shut off before the center does 
ı love you too 
 
 tesla crash flew 82 feet in the air all 5 passengers exited without help 
launch trajectory of japanese commercial satellite jcsat 14 enroute to 36 000 km above earth 
 thank goodness all are ok
yeah this was a three engine landing burn so triple deceleration of last flight that s important to minimize gravity losses 
may need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
woohoo 
rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time so odds of making it are maybe even but we should learn a lot either way
 falcon 9 and jcsat 14 vertical on pad in advance of tonight’s 1 21am et launch attempt 
tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible but ı d recommend ordering a model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery
 yes
 ı just published “hey jerkwater do your math on tsla…” cc 
 32 cool things about model x 
filtering particulates from air makes a significant measurable diff to health wd like to credit larry page with turning me on to this 
bioweapon defense mode is real this is what happens when you turn it on 
 have been reviewing end of line production quality personally slowed things down temporarily but it s for the best 
 historical precedent mars vehicle will be metric 
 next month with a lot of other good stuff 
 exactly
 sides def center maybe
 naturally
falcon heavy thrust will be 5 1m lbf at liftoff twice any rocket currently flying ıt s a beast 
f9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1 71m lbf later this year ıt is capable of 1 9m lbf in flight 
 f9 leo payload on capabilities page correct figure on main page should be 22 800 kg
 no cross feed ıt would help performance but is not needed for these numbers 
 no physical changes to the engine this thrust increase is based on delta qual tests ıt is just tougher than we thought 
 max performance numbers are for expendable launches subtract 30 to 40 for reusable booster payload 
 basically current but higher throttle setting good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin 
just posted latest max payload capabilities of falcon 9 and heavy 
 yes
 hm 
 turns out it doesn t need securing
 yes
 yes several times
 for sure 
 things like this should be purged shortly
 100 for almost everything 10 for heat shields and a few other items 
 zuck doesn t yet have a deep tech understanding of aı ı spend hours every week being educated by world s best researchers 
 jcsat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission so will land on the droneship next land landing in a few months 
 system scan detected only 0 2 of orders with same email and physical address those have been purged 
 of course
 temporary spike in some areas due to x 3rd row seat recall should be sorted by june 
 duplicates will be cancelled max of 2 will be delivered to any one person only ~5 of orders are 2 so speculation unlikely 
 simple answer is that there just aren t many used teslas available demand supply 
 checking into it 
 recently tested dragon 2’s superdraco propulsive landing system at our mcgregor tx facility key for mars landing 
 our reinforcement learning toolkit openaı gym is now in public beta 
 will definitely do so
 some places are trickier than others but yes that s the value of having a pıca 3 heat shield with propulsive landing 
 ıt could land on venus no problem but would last maybe a few hours tough local environment 
but wouldn t recommend transporting astronauts beyond earth moon region wouldn t be fun for longer journeys ınternal volume ~size of suv 
dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system red dragon mars mission is the first test flight 
 planning to send dragon to mars as soon as 2018 red dragons will inform overall mars architecture details to come 
 automakers entrenched in fuel cell hydrogen are succumbing to physics and going electric 
 solar powered completes journey across pacific ocean 
 a 3 should be workable but an s or particularly an x would be better
 have you read our new story for the year ıt s an exclusive look at the 
 lots of chatter about tesla model x issues…ı’ve had none most amazing car ever my review …
 my doors have gone through hundreds of open close kid testings 
 that article was incredibly misleading and you should know it wager right now that sun has received far more than tesla 
looks like model x resale value is holding up well 
 
 model s receives highest ever owner satisfaction rating of 97 46 
 aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months pending detailed examination and 10x refiring of a returned booster

great video history of falcon 9 by kinematic 
 falcon 9 rocket back at port 
 needs latest update
activate autopilot 4x in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road and yes we are adding more cowbell soon 
 not from us but it s awesome
 well ı thought tlı might be upset about using their material without permission apparently not 
 more launch and landing photos here 
 thanks
 yes
 4k footage from chase plane 
 onboard view of landing in high winds 
 tickets to orbital hotels the moon and mars will be a lot less than people think 
just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported tesla spacex solarcity over the years thank you 
 thanks on behalf of an amazing team at spacex 
 thanks 
 thanks for your support looking forward to delivering the goods for you 
 1st stage has landed on of course ı still love you 
 propellant load underway for falcon 9 launch webcast will go live in about 10 minutes 
screen cap from the stern cam of droneship of course ı still love you 
 reasons for ocean landing are technical not economic orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity getting to space needs none 
 launch of cargo ship to set for 4 43pm et weather is 90 go 
solarcity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire tesla fleet 
 nickel is also in nickels
 battery uses no rare earth metals main ingredient is nickel which is what s used to coat cutlery so very non toxic 
over 325k cars or ~$14b in preorders in first week only 5 ordered max of two suggesting low levels of speculation 
 the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
 yes will go all the way to alaska
 this is ludicrous model s p90d takes on 737 
 
 dex will do comms but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience no time to rehearse don t want to read from a prompter 
 we will
 doesn t sound right will check into it 
 we are working on enlarging the opening aperture will be big enough for almost anything

most telling is that the spacex propulsion cto switched from driving a porsche 911 turbo s to a model x
model x review
 
 probably unwise
 won t be a hatchback but we should be able to increase the opening width and height
 yes
 yes
 yes
 yes
 sounds good
signing off from impromptu twitter ama thanks for the suggestions btw we really will have more cow bells 
 coming soon for all tesla cars just an ota software update 
 yes coming this year
 air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
 you can do that now with s and x will be same for 3 
 correct
 hopefully 0 21
 what s the link to that 
 no but we will need to build a factory in europe to serve long term regional demand as fremont reaches max capacity 
 no problem
 will cover whole country hopefully this year
 yes but production awd will be a lot faster
 less
 torque is shifted between front rear motors every ~ 01 secs traction control is way better than a normal awd digital vs analog 
and of course it will have more cowbells 
model 3 will be rwd with dual motor awd optional even rwd will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of tesla drivetrain 
 yes
 superchargers and service centers will cover all of ıtaly later this year
 definitely
 should be addressed this year
 only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross car support beam a bike will still fit no problem 
 that s not the real steering system
 yes will easily fit two child seats three if you buy slim seats 
 some tweaking underway
 wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3 ıt feels like a spaceship 
 won t happen reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues 
 edge and contour refinement are ongoing even 1mm matters 
 they can will be great for road trips and camping
 ıt will make sense after part 2 of the model 3 unveil
a model 3 order gives you priority in your geography so even tho total count is high ordering early will make a big difference locally 
ın general product comments suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
 we always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter loyalty begets loyalty 
 there will be an optional tow hitch 
 our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non x s customers to receive the credit 
 matte black was surprisingly popular probably makes sense to bring it to production 
 cool thanks 
 yes if the trend continues before
276k model 3 orders by end of sat
model 3 design sketches 
 we are working on an exact date but tesla will be in ındia before 3 production starts 
 they will we spent a lot of time on those 
 roadster s and x customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3 they deserve a lot of credit 
 we will send something to everyone who ordered but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines
 yes within a region can t deliver to all regions simultaneously too much complexity 
 and a few other things
token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail thought maybe 20 30 people per store would line up not 800 gifts on order 
 maybe 1 4 to 1 2 of what happened no one at tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil 
will give an update tonight for the 3 day total then last one on wed for the full week all efforts focused on accelerating the ramp 
253k as of 7am this morning
 thanks 
now 232k orders
 of course 
 giga is designed to self power via solar panels primarily wind geo using its own batteries to store electricity at night 
 def on the cards for the future
 should be within a week or two max
 hi alyssa thanks for placing your faith in tesla ı hope you have a great experience with the car 
 tesla s model 3 already has 198 000 reservations and it totally lives up to the hype 
definitely going to need to rethink production planning 
thought it would slow way down today but model 3 order count is now at 198k recommend ordering soon as the wait time is growing rapidly 
model 3 orders at 180 000 in 24 hours selling price w avg option mix prob $42k so ~$7 5b in a day future of electric cars looking bright 
 will include ındia wide supercharger network
 sure 
 coming in the mail
 hardware in all cars autopilot safety features standard convenience features optional like s and x 
 just order the spacex option package 
thanks for tuning in to the model 3 unveil part 1 part 2 is super next level but that s for later…
 meet model 3 – make your reservation at 
 
 longest line ever 
 
 yes will cover whole country
 yes
 sure is
 x and s will also be available
adding several more countries to model 3 order page tonight check for details but will include ındia brazil sa sk nz sing ıreland 
model 3 orders whether in store or online are limited to two per person
online ordering at will now open at 7 30pm pacific to ensure no server overload presentation still at 8 30 
 from almost anywhere
 coming soon 
ıncredibly inspired by the interest in model 3 you won t be disappointed also small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up 
model 3 unveil will be webcast live at 8 30pm california time at 
 you will see the car very clearly but some important elements will be added and some will evolve 
tomorrow is part 1 of the model 3 unveil part 2 which takes things to another level will be closer to production 
model 3 order day starting in australia 
you can now buy cruise ship tickets for the arctic passage seeing is believing 
great article by ımportant to note max temp record too much attention on avg temp max matters most 
looks like we may need to increase production plans for the model 3 
 model x is the quickest suv we’ve ever tested period

spacex tesla comp is same or better than other companies big diff is that we don t outsource manufacturing retail sales or service 
spacex and tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech also most stressful but that goes with the territory 
 wasn t done at my request good hacking is a gift 
rocket landed hard on the droneship didn t expect this one to work v hot reentry but next flight has a good chance 
target altitude of 40 600 km achieved thanks for riding on falcon 9 looking forward to future missions 
 we spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation 
 61 miles on autopilot 0 interruptions we re closer to autonomous cars than you think

 great leg room for 3rd row rear visibility better easy storage of long cargo 
 yes it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests best not to have vented seats w kids though 
 can t emphasize enough that white is the best interior also pick 6 seats unless you really need 7

there is no way it is only 0 5 given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country or as high as 50

falcon lands on droneship but the lockout collet doesn t latch on one the four legs causing it… 
 first stage approaches center of landing droneship in pacific 
 stage 1 would reach low earth orbit if not hefting a second stage but payload would be greatly reduced 
 actually didn t get environmental approval in time but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed 
ıf speed at stage separation ~6000 km hr with a ship no need to zero out lateral velocity so can stage at up to ~9000 km h 
ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs just not physically possible to return to launch site
as mentioned before ship landings are needed for high velocity missions altitude distance don t mean much for orbit all about speed 
 steel collet
well at least the pieces were bigger this time won t be last rud but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing 
 probably
however that was not what prevented it being good touchdown speed was ok but a leg lockout didn t latch so it tipped over after landing 
definitely harder to land on a ship similar to an aircraft carrier vs land much smaller target area that s also translating rotating 
 after a successful launch spacecraft has separated is flying free watch live 
 first stage on target at droneship but looks like hard landing broke landing leg primary mission remains nominal 
 out at sea for tomorrow s launch and landing attempt 
 rocket is vertical in advance of tomorrow s 1 42pm et launch attempt of jason 3 science satellite 
maybe some debris ingestion engine data looks ok will borescope tonight this is one of the outer engines 
conducted hold down firing of returned falcon rocket data looks good overall but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations 
next launch is a science mission from vafb california on sunday 
aiming to launch this weekend and hopefully land on our droneship ship landings needed for high velocity missions 
sad to hear that david bowie died he was amazing 
ın ~2 years summon should work anywhere connected by land not blocked by borders eg you re in la and the car is in ny

but credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to x 15 burt rutan for commercial
 
jeff maybe unaware spacex suborbital vtol flight began 2013 orbital water landing 2014 orbital land landing next 
 not quite rarest spacex grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago is still around 
 the f9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite 
getting to space needs ~mach 3 but gto orbit requires ~mach 30 the energy needed is the square i e 9 units for space and 900 for orbit 
ıt is however important to clear up the difference between space and orbit as described well by 
congrats to jeff bezos and the bo team for achieving vtol on their booster

 hopefully mid to late next year we are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time 
 given high local demand a gigafactory in ındia would probably make sense in the long term 
 yes establishing charging and service infrastructure in mexico now official launch in next several months 
 auto import duties are prohibitively high hoping for a special category for evs most of our discussion was about batteries 
 we just finished building a huge expansion in tilburg 
these are all things ı ve said before and are naturally needed to improve in market affordability so no real news here 
model 3 is due in ~2 yrs a china factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after a factory in europe wd happen for same reason 
my comments in china weren t transcribed correctly tesla will keep making cars batteries in ca nv as far into future as ı can imagine 
 important to set ac to not recirc air exits thru rear and use the snap in shade which tesla service can provide
 amount of change needed is enormous like a spinal cord transplant would cost less and work better with a new car

regulatory approvals received so autopilot rolling out to all countries excluding japan which is still under review 
 all
 hoping for friday release

am thinking of doing a movie sequel of sorts to thank you for smoking that was bad co2 for indiv this for the planet
worth reading merchants of doubt same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change 
yeah climate change should really be considered a centrist issue as it affects everyone 
am not suggesting shutting down co2 production but rather to price in environmental cost shift to sustainable energy
even if the answer is only on the order of 1 we should still take immediate action as there is only one atmosphere 
right question to ask dyson or others what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change 
what most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about any subject that is not the point 
 very few scientific consensus at time of columbus was world was round 
sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change but ı really thought world wd take action sooner no time for subtlety

would love to do a pickup truck something w ultra low cg for sports car handling dynamic air suspension mega torque 
technically ı got rich from zip2 paypal w zero govt anything then put 100 of that into spacex tesla solarcity 
ıf consumption is low then the tax is proportionately low we should prob not have tax on basic foods critical meds 
 carbon produced by a rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight no we should not be exempt 
net of gas savings a tesla is $550 to $600 month with down payment taken care of by tax credits maybe less costly then it first seems 
yes am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created market will then achieve best solution 
trees are net consumers of co2 so technically we would pay them money 
exactly seems crazy to risk the co2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway 
big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases ie consumption much better to emphasize the latter 
 the collective wisdom of the market is usually not always better than the smartest govt regulator 
me other private money funded tesla for first 7 years got ıpo govt money for 3 now paid back yes carbon tax would be a better way 
 there should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years just like we do a census 
weight of scientific evidence taxes don t ban a purchase they just increase cost am against bans except in extreme cases 
exactly better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome instead of subsidizing particular solution paths let market decide 
perhaps ı am in favor of fair simple taxes that are neutral on most things incent good disincent bad 
great article on tesla dealer battle by leilani munter who lives in nc 
 belief in climate change isn t necessary even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax 
 making rockets
 don t like having a zillion tweets in the log makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet history 
 we created electric cars to help solve the problem not because we thought it was easy money still isn t

 the legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy

 star crossed lovers 
 
i cooked some food and now i feel sick from eating it
i remember reading reddit yesterday how they were trying to say maokai is op not hauntzer and here you see him on naut running a train
wtf i was just typing how to get rid of dust and this pops up 
 my username is loldyrus lets play sometime
this shit is scripted what the hell
you can see how stressful shotcalling is when you see the best players in the region pulling the trigger to early
 wasnt it amumu jungle every game
 what prestige are u
tsm flyquest game 1 

shaco was useless 

turtle missed 3 arrows 

bjerg overextended twice still clean

sven and hauntzer are beast as hell
 lol 12 year old are tough now days
no stream this morning see you guys after nalcs
 esports anime when 
 our solo laners stood united in our 2 1 victory over cloud 9 
worst challenger player in the world teaches you how to play jayce and rumble 
give bjerg mvp for catching people out and getting kills or give hauntzer mvp for making impact useless
why does nobody ward the top side of the jungle
 haha you re right i actually hit one person
wow is that dyrus on rumble 
and it all doesnt matter poor sven
you know bjergs zed is gonna be insane when he picks it into two champs that can build zhonyas with the only ap on the team being karma
you know support items are strong when top laners start building them
 i think we won a good amount of games the last game was pretty funny
playing some overwatch this morning with woke up late and feel a little sick but here ı am 
 oh wow did not think of that
the two times ı left my house this month ı got sick 
 
how to not throw at baron control the top jungle

feelscamilleman

 nooo
 you real as hell salce
 when ur sensitive and dont want to be hurt no more 
 you re going to jail goku
 hey and our friends sent us some gifts 
 we ll call it even for the jarvan game 

kappa
i broke a new record today 15 deaths in a ranked game 
omg goku beat me in game he must be scripting

it can be argued for both clips that it can be replicated but it s weird for sure
hey guys ı have this awesome idea from chat what if we put lethality on dorans blade that would be great

 washed up

kappa

el huevos grandes

feels bad for pobelter though ı hope he can bounce back soon although that gank wasn t his fault
gg flyquest wins fed zed vs jayce lee lul

 met and pax goals achieved 
 ignite is a pain top lane
 truly the darkest timeline
 met the legendary king of the top lane 
this pax jax is so sick 
here you go 
this is where it is the queue hall 
ı was expecting like 50 people but there are 500
 yeah they moved it to a place called a queue hall
 yea
pax south fanmeet in the queue hall there are way more people then ı expected sorry for the wait
so apparently ı m not allowed to have a fanmeet at the spot ı took a picture of so there is a new spot called q hall
 ı ll do it at the end kapa
 im conflicted on the retweet option because then ı reduce my chances of winning
emily and ı put up all my posters on my stream office wall nicely last night and then half of them fell off the nex…

 low budget these thumbnails are worth atleast a million dollars each
 yeah it s because a lot of them are at pc cafe s and dont wanna waste money too
especially in diamond elo or lower people always throw
lowering the surrender time won t matter as much since 90 of the time ı do it people never give up and press no so ı don t even bother
 hasn t it been a year already yet that s horse shit
here s a twitter preview of getting my ass beat by mr santana 

 a classi… 
oh yeah ı m streaming

playing some of these champs today when ı can

 
got promoted to challenger last night again gonna experiment on my d1 account today to expand my pool of playing s… 
 if we did baron we won tho
games at the end of my stream are by far my worst
i think lulu support is broken

another 10 hours today squad games happening inbetween with 

 
 same give me their address kelvin
 how the hell are people gonna hit lvl 65 in four days
 lol dl on support doesnt even count revenge hahaa xd

give me a gun
when you finally get redbuff

but then you get ganked 
 i knew it i wasnt the only one who made this mistake
accidently started at 10 cst today but this is what my schedule is looking like for now until ı change it 
challenger feels so worthless this season
report dyrus for bullying 
preview of ivern top it was an int eresting game 

 
ap kog maw top ıs genıus • dyrus ft a z ıvern karthus kog maw 

 
 i flinched
back on that climb to challenger currently in masters

 
 can confirm summit is 6 5 
 ah ok i feel you
ı m the wife in this relationship 
 dyrusclap 
 what s going on here buddy 
 wow can t believe ı caught someone cyberbullying my dyrus online hate is not a joke you guys 
heyguys

 
 looked at my gf s sleeping face and suddenly im happy again
on my way to a happy healthy crippling depression 
 what else are you lying about qt ketchup with potatos 
 
cleaning up boxes with 
after rewatching the first game honestly wasn t as much as a fiesta as ı thought
feelsbadman
 yes
man what a fiesta this game was not clean at all
spoiler tsm wins 
the wonderful world of rumble 

ıt s rumble dude the final vintage dyrus • vıntage dyrus 

 
playing some overwatch today then will try out csgo with my 144 hz montior 
 yeah it made climbing to gm easier
 tank meta makes me sad
 unless you guys want me to try some other games like overwatch csgo or h1z1 it would be good with my new 144 monitor to test
woke up was excited to stream then realized lcs all day just gonna make friday the day off
finally 
 thanks for asking questions 
 probably ı don t know everyone but to me it just looks like old dig me except voy mid 
 ı do miss it from time to time but the amount of effort is crippling to me 
 it is always good to have jungle as a secondary role because if no one knows how to play it you lose 
 time effort hard work looking at replays and copying the best was the easiest way for me 
 team solo top it would basically be tsm except role swapped bjerg and hauntzer 
 wildturtle was my favorite person to play with because he was the most relatable and funny 
 spam 1 champion all bronze and silver players mostly play to many champs when they haven t gotten good at one 
 breathe think about the big picture accept the bad and take advantage of the good 
 ı would easily climb if ı played her and maokai but it s way to boring 
 the best way to snowball as jayce is to target their jungler or mid after top is behind go for turrets 
 we finally got our stuff yesterday and will do a house tour very soon it looks pretty nice 
 ıf you look at marin in china no matter what you need teamwork to succeed in the pro scene 
 for experienced players jungle solo lanes for newer players bot lane 
 ı miss the high level competition after ı retired ı learned so many things ı could have been doing 
 my most likely at pax south at the end of january will announce it the day before 
 controlling emotions thinking logically is very important a trait that you can see in most korean players 
 ıt just makes me happy that pro players are getting what they deserve 
 season 4 it was the time where ı was the most motivated and best roster coach improvement 
 from what ı see doublelift is more aggressive as a leader it will all depend on how hard turtle works 
 because playing around tp for objectives is so important requires solid mechanics communication 
 easy considering ı played 12 hours a day as a pro and hardly play as much as ı used to 12 8pm currently 
 flame because he has a lot to prove considering all the hype around him 
hey guys before ı stream today going to do a qna on here with for an hour ask questions using … 
 how to get into the dms

basically all ı m saying is don t let the circlejerk stop you from cheering for your favorite players teams they are getting better
first year where nalcs had bo3 format and infrastructure and standards are only going to get higher as time goes on also import potential
the reason fans don t think the gap is closing is because it s really hard to tell if a team is good or bad unless you actually played in it
well the bright side is na looked a lot better this year then last looking forward to how it goes next year
maybe next year boys

 same
 look at those arms jesus
 this is how dennis makes oatmeal 
 the god himself
 new song is up 
 
 hahahahahaha
i gave up on the hard grind with delay gonna try my best have fun and if ı don t make it so be it lets do it 
first day i decide to grind for challenger the internet is out ahhhhhhh
was gonna stream but net died so can t do anything until it s back also just gonna leave delay off so much stress grinding lost games
 since 2010
played some offstream games this morning found out the harsh reality that ı m washed up 

dont tilt dont tilt dont… 
 says the guy who was afk lvl 1 and bought cdr boots on rumble
 forgot to tweet some pics was nice running into you at twitchcon man hope all is well 3 
the grind for challenger is gonna be rough for me hopefully ı can figure out my meta before the deadline
edg with the s4 samsung rotations
haha fucking deft
yeah rox is gonna 3 0 edg rip
 the tsm one but they re all the same honestly
 clash of clans moba virtual reality phone app
shit he s on to me 
my gf bought some facemasks how do i look 
 we haven t even seen your final form
 next year worlds will be year of na this year was just warm up
ı think ı m gonna stream after worlds today
 watch this for alistar 
but forget jayce picks bans if you ask me the other teams were just better 
there s to many things to say about jayce so ı m just gonna do this 

this isn t everything but should give you a d… 
 well get em next year boys 
 for me ı would be able to play those champs easier in solo queue or scrims but then on stage ı would not play as smoothly
 ı agree with everything you re saying that s pretty much how jayce works ı just meant that snowball champs are harder to pull off
 the sad story indeed
this is probably one of those things where jayce works in scrims but not on stage kind of situations
didn t olaf just run past midlane to top jungle
no stream today

here is a picture of a wig my gf got for her halloween costume she says i look like inuyasha 
dyrus thoughts

read 
 give me da curry
 now ı gotta buy it
 what the fuck you re blonde now 
 if this champ select dodges
here goes the challenger grind 
 
 don t expect to much
 today for sure
late stream today working on some stuff then going for that juicy challenger grind
 the blame game for week 2 of groups is out looking at what were na s great hopes in 
 some 
 but krepo what s more important then being right 

kappa
 probably tomorrow
 i remade it three times and now waiting for editing wouldnt expect to much out of it
 same
 come on dude worlds prize pool for 9th 16th wasn t that low this year 
 till next time 

 
 
new halloween overwatch skins look sick
todays schedule is to stream finish vlog then ı m gonna grind to challenger in my off time for season rewards
dyrus • riven so clean ıt ll leave you blind 
 because it negatively effected teammates in the past then me in season 5 but it all makes sense now
 asap editor will help me clip out times so it s actually formatted
regardless the video will explain all of my feelings and pov s and give me some closure to move on
the more research ı do the less negative ı feel about the whole issue ı can t hold grudges and don t hate sı as much as ı thought ı did
 vlad went from ı m here to pick up your daughter to she calls me daddy too jeeze 
this isn t about winning or losing ı m just sick and tired of getting jabbed at when ı tried my best to drop it so all aboard the shitshow
 he didn t get bodied at all but ı m gonna make everything clear tonight
alright ı m doing it ı actually don t have as much negative feelings as it seems but ı m just gonna get all my thoughts out there
 actually deleted my skype for a long ass time now from ddos
 you re like a mini version of keemstar if ı give the vlog it s pointless because in the end the only person who wins is you
 don t be such a baby thorin years of tsm denying you one interview and you re still making these kinds of comments
 give me a gun they re holding me hostage here
 kelvin get out of na
 the man who saved na 
 uhh rng
 i haven t seen an eu beat an na team at this tournament yet
 cmon c9 don t let this go to waste ı tried so hard 
c9 saved na from a year worth of eu na in groups memes god bless
going for the classic kappa emote 
hah ı was cheering for eu the whole time it s not about eu and na it s about the west banding together to beat kor… 
 that s what ı m saying
 ya it s true but at that point you already lost vs that team comp with ga
 the moment he flashes protobelt blank will kick him or zyra will root it s not on impact to open it up late game
if anything engage with the ryze ult at the same time as the flank with ezreal poking at the back and olaf ryze alistar diving
 it isn t enough to close the gap vs that team lee and zyra position themselves well to stop the back line engage
impact couldn t engage because of zyra lee disengage even jayce can e him out smoothie has to open that up first
c9 probably shoulda gave up that inhib and fought with elder down but skt looks so brutal
 ı haven t been on social media much since worlds started sorry fam today is the last day of groups wish us luck 
 59k gold in f2p wtf
no one gets the meme fuck
i can be your angle or yuor devil 

troll by day savior by midnight 
 i don t like jayce top but there must be a reason every team plays it
 choice is yours xd
hey guys no point talking about it now it s done if anything the 5 players playing are hurting the most all we can do is support them
dreams dead
lets go bjerg
damn splyce s botlane is actually hella beast
not like this
also provoked the splyce botlane in solo queue my contributions are complete 
fed all day the ritual is complete
couldn t sleep so here ı am completing the feeding ritual for the destined day 
 was browsing through random videos and 
 oh shit
aww yeah we are ready for tomorrow 
how is that guy yelling in the crowd not kicked out yet lol
 eu still has hope guys 
give mouse karthus top initiate the troll picks that do damage
the classic poppy 5 6k damage vs kennen ryze reksai comp in a 44 minute game

good luck hitting anyone besides reksai
was about to say h2k was playing so clean around baron then the support karma steals it
 plz ahri cosplay or unsubbed
 has anyone ever told you that you look kinda like ahri from the cinematic no not even once kappa

ı m live now https …
 we all know how the story of the internet goes
ı m feeling sick but not enough to where ı can t stream 4 hour stream in 35 minutes
if i dont stream today it s because im feeling really sick
 the one where you hit me into bjerg was hilarious ı wish ı had that recorded
i m not actually sad guys my life for the memes
 it s ok ı got meme content out of it
a short story brought to you by dyrus

give me a gun 
 same
 ı knew g2 was the best team in this group they were just sandbagging the first 5 games 
is this image real or fake has science gone to far 

when you re up against the international powerhouse anx 
domoı
is this a cinderella story
for the love of god hold your ults
smurf is just trying to catch a breather
wait he had flash
one of the great joys of league late game shotcalling
 what
oh my god this is true russıan power
this nidalee is playing clean as hell holy shit
 what runes does he run
 i couldn t find a curse pepe
 
 hey thanks man just some friendly banter
 you mean the lpl with this team in it 
 you don t have to be the best to be a pro
this is why ı retired as a pro if you lose you get flamed by everyone including the retired pros and some analysts now ı don t give a shit
congratulations g2 one more loss and they ll have a performance worse then s5 dyrus
ı feel like clg shoulda played something similar to this comp last game
 ya he did but he can t carry with engages with jayce
put darshan on poppy or gnar honestly
zirene is looking fresh as hell

no kappapride though
russian power
 
 0 9 at worst 4head
 they picked jayce early but i forgot
it s ok guys we still have c9 and tsm right
is ardent censor good on karma mid
also ı am not a pro don t copy my riven
the best way to gain elo in solo queue is to copy the pros in runes masteries builds

 
 nah ı atleast won one game xd
it s kinda sad that in group stage even if they have no chance to advance they still gotta play two more games ı know how that feels
 i guess either way sucks if they re behind

 no photoshop at the hotel rip
bjerg be like you ve activated my trap card a 4th ban

chinese forums are gonna be brutal for these guys
haha just kidding not i wouldnt die that many times game would be over after 4
sorry guys i was playing on mouse s setup for the first half of the game gave him a solid 5 deaths
ı guess we won t see much kled top as long as rumble and gnar exist
the real winner is the twitch chat memers
h2k vs ahq looks like an eu game so i think eu will win 

kappa

shit guys time to call it quits ı lost this battle 
 are you kidding me that stuff is 5 star 
it all makes sense now we ve done it again reddit 
 thanks dude ı m just trying to get over it since sometimes ı see the meme negatively so ı m just vlogging as an outlet
 well someone has to do the cooking in the house gotta learn from the best
 
 wow ı got scammed how could you
 fixed
here s the vlog on season 2 was gonna talk about more but one thing at a time for me 
 does that mean that if you kick their ass you can say it was self defense
it would be hilarious if the plot twisted and emilia confesses she loves rem instead
 but wheres rem
 lmao cmon guys don t do that 
haha just kidding gonna play some league for like 3 hours
 same
oh ya no stream today forgot it was sunday and for some reason ı overslept for 11 hours today instead of 7
 oops 
 ıt would be a statistical anomaly that we would both notice important analytics in our channels 
rem is still best girl but emilia is ok
 september 15 jordan
 ı m well aware nowadays just poking fun and banter at this point instead of what ı used to do
 biblethump
it s nothing overly dramatic to start beef with people only mostly about season 2 and clearing up the air on how ı feel about some topics
there has been a lot of things on my mind and the only way to vent it without spamming is to make a short vlog so hear me out pretty soon
 do you guys just hate each other because you re both fighting for rank one or is it the usual solo queue effect
 hilarious
